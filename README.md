# [mM]-Task
## Summary
Write a program in Java which takes an input text file and converts all the m's to M's and all the M's to m's. BTW, this is all it should do. It should not modify the input file in any other way. You should use the text file located at:

## Detailed Instructions

1. Set up your IDE. We recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
2. To manage the build process and the dependencies of our software we use maven. Familiarize yourself with maven. (http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html, http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)
3. Create a new maven project and implement the aforementioned mM task
4. Create a file called README.md with instructions on how to use the program
5. To test if our code is doing, what we think it does, we use junit tests or a similar testing framework. Familiarize yourself with the concept test driven deployment and create a JUnit for the task at hand. (See http://www.tutorialspoint.com/junit/junit_quick_guide.htm and https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world)
6. Write reasonable JUnit test for your application.
7. For sharing code we usually use github. Please create a github account and tell us your github user name. Make yourself familiar with git. (See https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
8. Upload your code to github.
9. To automate and ensure that the tests run independent of the local environment, we use continuous integration services such as travis. Find out how travis works.(http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners/)
10. Configure travis to automatically run your junit tests. (http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java/)

Good luck!

When you finish, please send us the input, the output, and also the program with instructions on how to run it.
